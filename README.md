### 3. **Frontend Ecosystem**
   - **Bundling**: Understand modern bundlers like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel, and how to configure them for optimization.
   - **Linting**: Use of linters like ESLint to enforce coding standards.
   - **Testing**: Experience with JavaScript testing frameworks like Jest, Cypress, Mocha, or Chai. Writing unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests.
   - **Version control**: Proficiency in Git for version control and collaboration.

### 4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - **Component-based architecture**: Experience building maintainable, scalable, and reusable components.
   - **State management**: Understanding of both local and global state management (e.g., Redux, React Context, MobX).
   - **Performance optimization**: Techniques for improving frontend performance, such as lazy loading, memoization, code splitting, and minimizing re-renders.
   - **Security**: Awareness of security practices like XSS, CSRF, and ensuring secure data handling on the frontend.

### 5. **Software Engineering Practices**
   - **Agile methodologies**: Familiarity with Agile software development, including Scrum and Kanban, and tools like Jira for issue tracking.
   - **Code Reviews**: Active participation in code reviews, ensuring high-quality code through collaboration and feedback.
   - **Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)**: Understanding of automating deployments, testing, and integration pipelines.

### 6. **Collaboration and Communication**
   - **Collaboration with Designers & Managers**: Strong communication skills for understanding user needs and collaborating on design and feature requirements.
   - **Mentoring**: Ability to onboard and mentor junior engineers, guiding them through development processes and best practices.

### 7. **Soft Skills and Mindset**
   - **Problem-solving**: Ability to analyze problems from multiple angles and find effective solutions.
   - **Attention to detail**: Ensuring the code is of high quality and scalable.
   - **Long-term code quality**: Writing code that is sustainable, maintainable, and performant for the long run.
   - **Remote collaboration**: Given the fully remote nature of the role, being self-motivated and effective at asynchronous communication is essential.

### Optional, But Helpful:
   - **Cloud Development**: Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) and developing apps for the cloud.
   - **CI/CD Tools**: Experience with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.
   - **Design Systems**: Exposure to design systems like Atlassian's own or Material UI for consistent UI development.
